CTS Verifier Automation
---------------------

This is a set of configurable automated testcases to help in reducing the manual effort for
executing CTS-Verifier.
These cases are intended to be used with UIConductor (https://github.com/google/android-uiconductor)

The cases are designed to be easily modified for custom implemented Android user interfaces,
focusing on the modifications to global variables which affect how the testcases use UI elements.
